# HVAC Flow Pro — Initial placeholder

This repository is the HVAC Flow Pro scaffold. This single README is intentionally minimal so you can add it to an empty GitHub repository to make the repo non-empty and allow automated pushes or further CI to run.

How to add this file to an empty GitHub repo locally and push to main:

1. Save this file as `README.md` at the root of your local project folder.

2. Run these commands from that folder (SSH example):
```bash
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "chore: add initial README to make repo non-empty"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:minimizedmark/HVAC-Flow-Pro-scaffold.git
git push -u origin main
```

(Or use HTTPS remote if you prefer:
git remote add origin https://github.com/minimizedmark/HVAC-Flow-Pro-scaffold.git)

3. Once this file is pushed and the repository is no longer empty, tell me and I will push the full scaffold or create the initial commit remotely for you.

Notes:
- This README is deliberately lightweight so you can get the repo out of the "empty" state quickly.
- After pushing, I can continue with adding the full project, wiring Stripe checkout routes, or creating branches/PRs as you direct.
